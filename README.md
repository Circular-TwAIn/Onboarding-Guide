# Onboarding Guide

This guide is intended to technically prepare providers and customers in the CircularTwAIn pilots, focusing on Battery / Electronic Waste Recycling and Petrochemical optimizations.
Digital Twins (DT) and Digital Product Passports (DPP) play a big role in the CircularTwAIn architecture to enable circular value chains. By sharing relevant material / component data with product customers and recycling centers as DPPs, KPIs for better product recycling decisions and material re-use can be increased. For example, a recycling center receiving different types of batteries can benefit from reading battery statistics and material compositions from a DPP. The upcoming battery passport will be mandatory by 2027 as stated by the EU Battery Regulation for all EV batteries and industrial batteries with a capacity > 2 kWh. 

A possible standardized solution to implement DPPs and DTs is the Asset Administration Shell, proposed by the german association Plattform Industrie 4.0 and Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA). To exchange data, all providers and customers will be part of one or more data spaces.

Please select your role in the circular value chain:

* [Component manufacturer](Componentmanufacturer.md) (i.e. display panel)
* [Product manufacturer](Productmanufacturer.md) (i.e. LCD monitor)
* [End user](Customer.md) (customer)
* [Recycler](Customer.md)
